My name is Brenton Earl.  I am a freelance system administrator with
experience in web development.  I also have some hands on experience in
network engineering and security.  I use open source software when it is
feasible and I avoid proprietary software whenever possible.  My
favorite operating system is Slackware Linux.  When the weather is right
I like to go fishing and hiking.
