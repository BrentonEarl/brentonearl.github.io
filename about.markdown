#### About the Author

Hello to my fellow readers!
	
My education involves Computer Networking and System Administration.  I have professional experience administering Debian and Cent OS servers on a large scale basis.  In college I was trained to best practice security techniques on Linux Systems, Windows systems, and small to medium scale networks.   Although my education includes Microsoft Systems, I tend to avoid using Windows whenever possible in my personal life.  I prefer the freedom offered by Open Source software and I enjoy the challenge of using Linux to complete complicated tasks.  I also do not believe that anyone should pay for their Operating System or its included software.

I enjoy expanding my horizons.  The content on this site is written in a tutorial style format so that others can benefit from the documentation I create as I complete various projects.  Some of the articles on this site were created during my time in college and the topics were chosen based on what I felt was important for myself to remember.  After I graduated from college, I decided to continue writting tutorials covering a wider range of topics based on my curiosities.  However, you will find a good deal of articles that are blog posts discussing various topics that are not using the tutorial format.

In the passed I was mostly interested in using software, breaking software and securing software.  Recently I have taken a deep interest in creating software.  My programming language of choice is Ruby.  I pride myself in being able to know a bit of everything about as many topics as i can.  I plan to change that habit and gain some expertise in specific areas of interest.  I enjoy building web applications using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and I also enjoy building static sites using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  You should expect to see a great deal of articles on this site covering Ruby, Sinatra and jekyll related topics.  Being the Linux fanatic that i am, you can also expect to see articles discussing Linux and Open Source software.

I hope you enjoy your stay and find this site interesting.
