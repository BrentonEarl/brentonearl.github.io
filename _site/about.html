			<h4>About the Author</h4>

<p>Hello!  My name is Brenton Earl.</p>

<p>My education involves  Computer Networking and System Administration.  I have professional experience administering Debian and Cent OS servers on a large scale basis.  In college I was trained to in best practice security techniques on Linux Systems, Windows systems, and small to medium scale networks.   Although my education includes Microsoft Systems, I tend to avoid using Windows whenever possible in my personal life.  I prefer the freedom offered by Open Source software and I enjoy the challenge of using Linux to complete complicated tasks.</p>

<p>I enjoy expanding my horizons.  The content on this site is written in a tutorial style format so that others can benefit from the documentation I create as I complete various projects.  Many of the articles on this site were created during my time in college and the topics were chosen based on what I felt was important for myself to remember.  After I graduated from college, I decided to continue writting tutorials covering a wider range of topics based on my curiosities.</p>

<p>In the passed I was mostly interested in using software, breaking software and securing software.  Recently I have taken a deep interest in creating software.  My programming language of choice is Ruby.  I pride myself in being able to know a bit of everything about a topic.  I plan to change that habit and gain some expertise in specific areas of interest.  I enjoy building web applications using <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> and I also enjoy building static sites using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.  You can expect to see a majority of the remaining articles on this site cover Ruby, Sinatra and jekyll related topics.</p>

<p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/BrentonLeeEarl">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Please head over to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exitstatusone">Facebook Page</a> and show me some love with a like.</p>
