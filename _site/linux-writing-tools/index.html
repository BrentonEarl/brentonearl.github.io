							<p>Most Writing and Editing is done from Mac or Windows.  What about those who use Linux that wish to Author a book, a short story or create a blog?  Most will say all that is needed is a word processor and a nice cup of tea.  Generally speaking, it is important to write in a creative and focused environment.  Structure is needed to be successful.  Thoughts need to be organized so that content can be methodically laid out.  A writer’s work area needs to compliment their personality and allow for ideas to flow freely.  For large projects, it is important to be organized as well.  There are a number of pieces of software that allow for such an environment.  I will outline the tools I use to stay structured, organized, creative, focused and successful.</p>

<p>The first step to any type of writing is organization.  Notes, brainstorming and an outline are all essential in the early stages of a written work.  The tool I use to stay organized is called Zim Wiki.  Think of Zim as a personal desktop wiki, where you can document each and every thought you have regarding your current work.  Notes can be ordered into a hierarchy of indexes, pages, lists, bullets and graphs.  Separate works can be saved into “notebooks” and kept confined so that information is easy to find.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>In order to work quickly and effectively, every writer must have access to a dictionary and a thesaurus.  Sometimes it is hard to think of a different way to say something.  A thesaurus allows for different words to express the intended topic, without sounding redundant.  A dictionary is there so that you can get a full understanding of alternate words.  Artha thesaurus is an excellent piece of software.  It not only gives definitions of each synonym, but it also shows usage of each word in a sentence. Additionally, it shows similar words, “part of”, “kinds” and “parts.”  The nicest features is that it uses an off line database.  Most Linux desktop environments come with a built in dictionary software.  I use Xfce, which comes with Xfce4 Dictionary.  It works well and it is simple to use.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-dict">Xfce4 Dictionary</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Most people have different ideas of what they think to be a structured and focused environment when it comes to writing.  I get distracted easily if I can see everything I have open on my desktop.  I generally have a news reader, several terminal windows, media player and web browser open if I am only writing.  On a typical day I will also have video, graphic, and audio design software open. Sometimes I also have Zim wiki and possibly some Virtual Box machines running.</p>

<p>The software I use to write content is called FocusWriter.  It is a full screen word processor that includes just what is necessary to spit words out on to paper.  It is very effective.  I write all my blog posts, papers and essays using FocusWriter.  I will not outline all of the features, you can read them for yourself.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>You created your content, spell checked it, edited it and you think it is ready for the press.  Scribus is a Desktop Publishing software that is free, and runs on most Linux distributions.  I have not completed a full project with Scribus just yet, but I must say I am impressed.  You can create news paper articles, magazine articles and books.  Scribus will allow you to make your ready for print, or turn them into PDFs.</p>

</ul>


<p>The last piece of software I want to talk about is called Calibre.  Calibre is an Open Source E-book management software.  It allows you to not only read E-books, but also convert to different formats and download new E-books.  It supports ePub and Mobipocket formats.</p>
