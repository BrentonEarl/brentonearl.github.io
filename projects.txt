Projects
---------

.Blotter Blogging Software
****
Some time ago I created a minimalistic blogging software.  It was my 
first real attempt at developing a Ruby based web application.  I 
titled it *Blotter*.  It really can easily be adapted to multiple uses 
aside from blogging.  It includes authentication and a number of other 
features.

.My SlackBuilds Repository
****
I maintain and test a number of *SlackBuilds* for the Slackware 
distribution Slackbuilds.org repository.  Slackbuilds.org is a third 
party software repository that contains build scripts to aid in 
compiling software sources into binaries for the Slackware 
distribution.

Contributions

.Slpkg Package Manager
****
*Slpkg* is a user-friendly pacage manager for Slackware installations.  
This software boasts automatic dependency resolution. Many GNU/Linux 
users consider dependency resolution an important feature for their 
Operating System.  Mostly I test this software and report bugs to aid 
in the development process.
