About the Author
-----------------

.Welcome to my site!
****
My name is 'Brenton Earl'.  Here I will share a brief background 
covering my skill set and my philosophy about Technology.
	
My education involves Computer Networking and System Administration.  
I have professional experience administering Debian and CentOS 
servers on a large scale basis.  My training and experience include 
best practice security techniques with Linux Systems, Windows systems, 
and small to medium scale networks.

I prefer the freedom offered by Open Source software, so you will not catch me using a proprietary Operating System. I believe that software should be free.  I also believe that the very nature of Open Source communites 
allow the Information Technology community to grow.  Open Source 
allows IT to grow in ways that would never be possible if society 
strictly relied on proprietary software companies.

I enjoy expanding my horizons.  For this very reason I make an effort 
to involve myself in various Open Source projects to contribute in any 
way my skill set allows.  I do not contribute because I wish to 
receive credit or because I receive any type of compensation.  I do what 
I do because of my passion for technology and to sate my hunger to help 
others in any way I can.  Contributing to Open Source projects allows 
me to feel a sense of pride in what I know and in my work.
