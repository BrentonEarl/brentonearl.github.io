About the Author
-----------------

.Welcome to my site!
My name is Brenton Earl.  The following is mean to be a brief summary 
of my skill set and my philosophy about Technology.  If you wish to 
contact me, my information is http://exitstatusone.com/contact.html[here].

.Education and Experience	
In college I trained as a Network Engineer and System Administrator.  
Out of necessity I taught myself how to program in Ruby, Python, and 
Bash. My training also includes best practice security techniques 
with GNU/Linux Systems and Windows systems in small to medium sized 
networks.

I have professional experience administering Debian Linux and CentOS 
Linux servers in the Enterprise.  From time to time I develop Web 
applications for various clients, which yields me intermediate 
experience with XHTML/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and 
http://www.sinatrarb.com/[Sinatra].  At home I administer several 
Slackware Linux physical and virtual installations which are used to 
organize my Open Source projects for testing and development.

.Philosophy
I prefer the freedom offered by Open Source software, so you will 
not catch me using a proprietary Operating System. I believe that 
software should be free.  I also believe that the very nature of 
Open Source communites allow the Information Technology industry 
to grow.  Open Source allows Technology fields to grow in ways 
that would never be possible if society strictly relied on 
proprietary software companies.

I enjoy expanding my horizons.  For this very reason I make an effort 
to involve myself in various Open Source projects to contribute in any 
way my skill set allows.  I do not contribute because I wish to 
receive credit or because I wish to receive compensation.  I 
contribute because of I have a great passion for technology. I also 
contribute to help others in any way I can.  Contributing to Open 
Source projects allows me to feel a sense of pride in what I know 
and in my work.
