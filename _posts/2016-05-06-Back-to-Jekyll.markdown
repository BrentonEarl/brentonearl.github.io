I wanted to switch back to Jekyll for quite some time now.  Using
AsciiDoc for my web site proved to be very low maintenance and required
very little effort to add new content.  I am going back to Jekyll
because I want to see how the project has progressed since I last used
it.  AsciiDoc is great but it is very boring to use!

I plan to use this version of the site as a blog.  I will post updates
or tutorials depending on what project I am working on, and what I think
may be of interest to others.

I will not be bringing back old site content from my previous jekyll
site.  There have been far too many advancements and changes with Jekyll
since I used that source code.  You can find the old source code on my
GitHub account If you are interested in looking it over.
