Most of the really good Android Apps out there are not free.  Finding the really useful Android Apps can be a task, and takes a lot of time to achieve.  Aside from games and Apps like Facebook or twitter, there is a plethora of Apps out there that have many different uses.  The obvious ones are Apps like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube that are commonly built into Android OS and Apple based phones.    This article is meant to be an outline of the Apps I use from day to day for a variety of tasks.  Most of these Apps can be found in the Google Play store.

####Wifi Analyzer

-  This app is great if you need detailed information regarding the available Wifi access points in your vacinity.  It will give you information about your current access point, like your current IP address for example.  It allows you to test the signal strength of all of the wifi access in range of your phone.

####HTTP Lite Server

-  Host a web site directly on your Android Phone!  Useful for a variety of tasks.  If you use your imagination, I am sure you will come up with many of your own uses.  I use it to share a long list of images that are located on my phone over Wifi without having to spend the time to upload them to another web site or send them in text messages.

####Google Voice

-  If you have a gmail account, you can hook your phoneâ€™s voicemail into this app.  It will allow you to log into a web interface on your computer and view your contacts and every voicemail you ever received from the date you installed the App.  Each voicemail is transcribed if you wish to read, rather than listen to your voicemails.

####123 People Search

-  Great if you need to pull of basic information on an acquaintance or somebody you want to passively find information on.  I use it to do address look ups and phone number look ups when I have lost the contact information on a friend.

####AVG Anti-Virus

-  With all of the recent news about viruses in the Google Play store and from other sources, it is a good idea to get some sort of anti-virus for your smart phone.  It will scan apps as they are being installed, and do full scans of your phone after the fact to verify there are no malicious apps installed.

####Android Task Manager

-  Discovering what apps are running on your Android based phone can be difficult.  This app will allow you to monitor and end processes that are running on your phone.  Very similar to Windows Task manager, but for Android Phones.

These are the Apps I most frequently use from day to day.  There are other apps I have installed, but they require your phone to be jail broken in order to have administrative access over the phone.
