Let's say you wanted to do away with Gnome, KDE, Xfce, LXDE, or any other GUI based desktop environment on your Debian system. There are many reasons somebody would want to do this.... save disk space, novelty, minimalism, or you simply want to use a different interface.

I have compiled a list of applications that use the Linux framebuffer device.  In essence, you would have a fully operational desktop environment without the dependencies of a large Gnome or KDE environment.  Here is the list:

-  IM Client: Finch
-  Word Processor: Wordgrinder
-  Programming: vim
-  PDF Viewer: fbpdf
-  Image Viewer: fbi (frame buffer image viewer)
-  Image Editor: fbida
-  Log in manager:  Qingy
-  Screen Shots:  fbgrab
-  Web Browser:  links2
-  Media Player:  mplayer
-  Desktop Environment:  directfb
-  Desktop Environment:  XDirectfb
-  Terminal Window Manager:  GNU screen

This list is by far incomplete.  There are so many options out there for framebuffer applications.  I currently do not use a framebuffer type environment, but I have in the past.  My personal experience is that I have very few limitations, and a far faster computer this set up.
