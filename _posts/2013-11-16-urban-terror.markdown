Way back in the day I played Doom, Quake 2, Quake 3, Action Quake, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Medal of Honor: Breakthrough.  I was a big fan of first person shooters.  Out of nostalgia I decided to start playing [Urban Terror](http://www.urbanterror.info) because it is based on the code from Quake 3 Arena.  Of course it has different player models and maps, but there are a few maps people recreated that I played in the previously mentioned first person shooters.  I used to be very strict about the realism involved in the games I played, but that all went away with my long time binge of MMO's. Some aspects of Urban Terror are realistic but Urban Terror plays more like Quake 2, which was not realistic at all. 

In favor of completely immersing myself in the game I decided to put up a game server for Urban Terror.  The installation process and configuration is quite simple. Setting up the server is literally no more complicated than adding values to a series of 1 and 0 switches for each feature you would like the server to allow.  I will be adding better maps and removing the bots as more players join to play on it consistently.  I may also hack the server binary for Urban Terror so that I have more control over various administrative tasks some time in the future. The current status of the game server can be found below in the banner.

In addition to hosting my own game server, I also found a nice bunch of people to play the game with.  Most of the Urban Terror player base is European players, but I was lucky enough to be accepted into a North American clan called [Not Even Trying](http://www.noteventrying.net/).  All of their server information (including TeamSpeak) can be found on their web site.  They also have an IRC channel on [QuakeNet](www.quakenet.org), #noteventrying, in case you would like to check it out.  __Rant__:  I previously stuck around [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) during all of my IRC escapades but have recently decided to take a step back from my contributions to the Open Source Community to use the interwebz for fun.  =0  I've spent far too long anonymously contributing to many different projects under various aliases...  More on topic now.


There are a few really good resources that will guide you through the Urban Terror world, in the event you have never heard of or are new to the game.  A number of them I found peticularly helpful in getting up to speed on game play, tactics and server administration.

If you plan on hosting an Urban Terror Game Server you can use the following Ban lists to keep your server free of Wall hackers and Aim botters.  I have a little bash script I use to update my banlist.txt that encompases all of the IP addresses listed, I just have not had the time to perfect it.  Once I have it working seamlessly I will post it, so keep checking back.

There will be more to come in the future covering Urban Terror.  I plan to do my best to get some content regarding the game indexed at the top of google so that more people begin to play the game.  It is an older game, but it is still current and free to play.  For those of you who know me personally you can find me on QuakeNet in #noteventrying if you have any questions or if you are looking for a clan, just mention this web site and I will PM you if I am not idle.
