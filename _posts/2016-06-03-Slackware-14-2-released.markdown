The long awaited release of Slackware Linux 14.2 is finally here.  I
know I am a bit late with my post.  I have been very busy updating my
systems at home and for clients.  This includes my 2 Raspberry Pi's, old
Dell Inspiron laptop, My ZaReason Stratta 7440, and several virtual
private servers.

Everything is extremely stable.  I guess I forgot what it meant to run a
stable system due to the fact that the last couple years I was either
tracking Debian Sid/Unstable or Slackware -current (Slackware
development branch).

You are missing out if you are not running Slackware on at least one of
your systems!  Slackware provides a systemd free environment, stable
software, and empowers the user to take advantage of complete control of
the operating system.
