Most Writing and Editing is done from Mac or Windows.  What about those who use Linux that wish to Author a book, a short story or create a blog?  Most will say all that is needed is a word processor and a nice cup of tea.  Generally speaking, it is important to write in a creative and focused environment.  Structure is needed to be successful.  Thoughts need to be organized so that content can be methodically laid out.  A writer’s work area needs to compliment their personality and allow for ideas to flow freely.  For large projects, it is important to be organized as well.  There are a number of pieces of software that allow for such an environment.  I will outline the tools I use to stay structured, organized, creative, focused and successful.

The first step to any type of writing is organization.  Notes, brainstorming and an outline are all essential in the early stages of a written work.  The tool I use to stay organized is called Zim Wiki.  Think of Zim as a personal desktop wiki, where you can document each and every thought you have regarding your current work.  Notes can be ordered into a hierarchy of indexes, pages, lists, bullets and graphs.  Separate works can be saved into “notebooks” and kept confined so that information is easy to find.

In order to work quickly and effectively, every writer must have access to a dictionary and a thesaurus.  Sometimes it is hard to think of a different way to say something.  A thesaurus allows for different words to express the intended topic, without sounding redundant.  A dictionary is there so that you can get a full understanding of alternate words.  Artha thesaurus is an excellent piece of software.  It not only gives definitions of each synonym, but it also shows usage of each word in a sentence. Additionally, it shows similar words, “part of”, “kinds” and “parts.”  The nicest features is that it uses an off line database.  Most Linux desktop environments come with a built in dictionary software.  I use Xfce, which comes with Xfce4 Dictionary.  It works well and it is simple to use.

Most people have different ideas of what they think to be a structured and focused environment when it comes to writing.  I get distracted easily if I can see everything I have open on my desktop.  I generally have a news reader, several terminal windows, media player and web browser open if I am only writing.  On a typical day I will also have video, graphic, and audio design software open. Sometimes I also have Zim wiki and possibly some Virtual Box machines running.

The software I use to write content is called FocusWriter.  It is a full screen word processor that includes just what is necessary to spit words out on to paper.  It is very effective.  I write all my blog posts, papers and essays using FocusWriter.  I will not outline all of the features, you can read them for yourself.

You created your content, spell checked it, edited it and you think it is ready for the press.  Scribus is a Desktop Publishing software that is free, and runs on most Linux distributions.  I have not completed a full project with Scribus just yet, but I must say I am impressed.  You can create news paper articles, magazine articles and books.  Scribus will allow you to make your ready for print, or turn them into PDFs.

The last piece of software I want to talk about is called Calibre.  Calibre is an Open Source E-book management software.  It allows you to not only read E-books, but also convert to different formats and download new E-books.  It supports ePub and Mobipocket formats.
