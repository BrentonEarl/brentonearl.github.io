Every part of a individual’s social life and financial life can be integrated into to their mobile device.  Banking, Communications and nearly every portion of personal information can be present within a smartphone or tablet.  Android Mobile devices are vulnerable to a number of different attacks.  Some of the vulnerabilities are Man in the Middle Attacks, Bluebugging, Bluesnarfing, Phishing, Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, Buffer Overflows, Privilege Escalation, Keylogging and Backdoors.  Attacks against Android devices can be automated using the [Smartphone Pentest Framework](http://www.bulbsecurity.com/smartphone-pentest-framework/), Metasploit, [Social Engineering Toolkit](https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/), Ettercap an a variety of other tools.

The latest popular attack is creating “backdoored” apps that allow the attacker to take full control of every portion of a device.  Apps that have a built-in Backdoor are the greatest threat to Android users everywhere.  Attackers can effectively use the Google Play Store to build a mobile device [Botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet).

According to a [post](http://bluebox.com/corporate-blog/bluebox-uncovers-android-master-key/) on the Bluebox Security blog, attackers managed to find a way to modify APK code to include a trojan without breaking the cryptographic signature used by the Google Play App store.  This vulnerability has been present since the release of Android 1.6.  For four years, 900 million old and new devices have been vulnerable to this expoloit.  The vulnerability was reported to Google in February 2013.
