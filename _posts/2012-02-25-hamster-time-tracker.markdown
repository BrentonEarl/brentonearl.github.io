Recently I found the need to track my time due to recent work opportunities.  I originally thought it best to install one of the various time clock software that are available to Linux.  After searching around and much contemplating, I found [Hamster](http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/).  Hamster is a simple desktop applet that embeds in the Gnome task bar.  I also found [KTimeTracker](http://userbase.kde.org/KTimeTracker) but I didnâ€™t find it as appealing as Hamster.

Project Hamster Features I enjoy the most:

- Ability to track your work day by hour and minute
- Ability to enter passed hours and minutes into the tracker
- Statistical summarization of all time spent, seperated by Tag
- Ability to export your time reports in HTML format for easy viewing
- The bottom line is that if you need to track your time in a simple and straightforward way, Hamster is your solution.  It has all of the required features to be used as a personal time clock to organize your work day.
