Recently I decided to start creating videos to go along with my posts.  Typically I do not like to speak in my videos (bad microphone) and I have been desperate to find some audio content to mix into each video to create a better viewing experience.  Many people would tell me to download a torrent, but I think I found an alternative .  Hopefully this will inspire podcasters, remixers, and anyone who likes to listen to music to utilize The Free Music Archive to enhance their audio experience.

The Free Music Archive is an interactive library of high-quality, legal audio downloads.  The Free Music Archive is directed by WFMU, the most renowned freeform radio station in America.  Radio has always offered the public free access to new music. The Free Music Archive is a continuation of that purpose, designed for the age of the internet.
