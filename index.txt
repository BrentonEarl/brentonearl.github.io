.2015-07-22:  Major Site Update
****
After several years of blogging, I've decided to call it quits.  I 
regret to inform my readers that all of the old site content will no 
longer be available as apart of the live 
http://exitstatusone.com[Exit Status One] domain.  This web site is 
transitioning from a blogging site, to purely an informational site.  
In the future I will make old site content available in a separate 
Github repository.  More news on this at a later date.	

I have also decided to move from http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] to 
http://asciidoc.org/index.html[AsciiDoc].  Jekyll has been a great 
asset in assisting a simplified blogging process.  However, in the future 
the functionality of the site will no longer require all of what Jekyll 
provides.  AsciiDoc will allow me to simplify site development in ways 
that Jekyll will not.

The http://exitstatusone.com[Exit Status One] web site will continue to 
be available at this domain.

'Brenton Earl'
