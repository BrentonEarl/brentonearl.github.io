.2015-07-23:  Old Site Content 
****
As stated previously, this site has undergone major changes.  For 
those readers who wish to access the old site content, it can be 
found
https://github.com/BrentonEarl/brentonearl.github.io/tree/old_source[here].
As long as GitHub remains in existence, all of this content will 
continue to be available.  To use this source you can view 
articles in the _posts directory as plain text in any text editor.  
Or if you choose to, you can install Ruby and 
http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] to run the site on your computer.

To download it, please use the git command shown below.

git clone -b old_source --single-branch https://github.com/BrentonEarl/brentonearl.github.io.git

.2015-07-22:  Major Site Update
****
After several years of blogging, I've decided to call it quits.  I 
regret to inform my readers that all of the old site content will no 
longer be available as apart of the live 
http://exitstatusone.com[Exit Status One] domain.  This web site is 
transitioning from a blogging site, to purely an informational site.  
In the future I will make old site content available in a separate 
Github repository.  More news on this at a later date.	

I have also decided to move from http://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] to 
http://asciidoc.org/index.html[AsciiDoc].  Jekyll has been a great 
asset in assisting a simplified blogging process.  However, in the future 
the functionality of the site will no longer require all of what Jekyll 
provides.  AsciiDoc will allow me to simplify site development in ways 
that Jekyll will not.

The http://exitstatusone.com[Exit Status One] web site will continue to 
be available at this domain.
